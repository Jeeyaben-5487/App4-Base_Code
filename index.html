Brief Description of Goal of Code:
This app allows the user to differentiate between a bedbug bite and a spider bite through a series of questions and results at the end. This app is not meant to diagnose anything. The web-based app is created using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. 
 
Known Issues:
The questionnaire is too short and does not account for any other factors that could contribite to an illness. 
Ignore this error message if you see it using the javaScript console: Error with Permissions-Policy header: Origin trial controlled feature not enabled: 'interest-cohort'.
